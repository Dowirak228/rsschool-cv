# **About Me**
 My name is Nodir. I am 19 years old. Currently i do not working anywhere and do not studying at university as well.

 My hobby is programming. I started my journey in this field 1 and half years ago. Started with IOS development and i loved it but I quit because i did not find any job as an intern/ junior IOS developer in spite of i could build any mobile app of junior level.

 My goal is to improve myself in frontend development. That's why i need to get a job at Epam. Cause Epam is an American most powerful company that exist in Central Asia.
